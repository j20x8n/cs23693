1.                   a.                   Use the   Miller   approximation   to   calculate   the   −3-dB   frequency   of   the   small-signal   voltage   gain   of   a   common-source   transistor   whose   ac   schematic   is   shown below.    Assume   the dc drain   current ID = 0. 5 mA.    Also,   assume   that W = 100   µm, L drawn = 2   µm, Ld = 0.   2   µm, Xd = 0, λ = 0, k′ = 60   µA/V2   , χ = 0, Cdb = 0, Cgb = 0, and fT = 3   GHz (at ID = 0. 5 mA).
b.                   Calculate   the   nondominant   pole   magnitude    for   the   circuit   in   (a).      Compare   your answer with a   SPICE simulation.

2.                   For   the   circuit   below,   assume   that VI is   adjusted   so   that ID = 0. 5 mA.      Calculate   the low-frequency   small-signal voltage gain vo /vi , and use the zero-value   time-con- stant method to estimate the −3-dB frequency.    Use the   same   data   as   in   the   previous   problem except:
a. Cdb ≠ 0.                      Calculate                the                zero-bias                drain-bulk                   capacitance                as Cdb0 = AD (Cj0′) + PD (Cjsw0′),   where AD = (5   µm)W   is   the   drain   area   and PD = W is            the            drain            perimeter.               Let Cj0′ = 0.   4   fF/(µm2   )            and Cjsw0′ = 0.   4   fF/µm.   Use Equation (1.202) with ψ0 = 0. 6 V to calculate Cdb . In case you do not have the book, Equation (1.202) shows that 
b. Cox ′ = 0. 7   fF/(µm2   ), and fT is no   longer   given.

3.                   Consider   the   ampliﬁer   stage   shown   below.      Assume IB is   adjusted   so   that   the   dc
output voltage VO = 0.
a.                   Calculate the low-frequency,   small-signal transconductance vo /ii ,   and use   the   zero-value   time-constant   method   to   estimate   the   −3-dB   frequency.      Use   the   formula       for Cdb0                given       in       Problem       2.             For       all       transistors,       assume L drawn = 2   µm, Ld = 代 写EEC 210 Analysis and design of analog integrated circuits HW 7C/C++

(1.201)   shows that  and   Equation   (1.202)   is   given   in the
previous          problem.                For M1   ,             assume Vtp = − 1 V, kp = 20   µA/V2   ,

b.                   Repeat    (a)   with   a   20-pF   capacitor   connected   from   the   drain   to   the   gate   of M1   .

4.                   An   ampliﬁer   stage   is   shown below.    Calculate   the   zero-bias   drain-bulk   and   source-
bulk                                  capacitances                                    as Cdb0 = AD (Cj0′) + PD (Cjsw0′)                                  andCsb0 = AS (Cj0′) + PS (Cjsw0′),    where AD = AS = (5   µm)W   is      the      drain      and      the source    area    and PD = PS = W is    the    drain    and    the    source    perimeter.

Use   Equations   (1.201)   and   (1.202) with ψ0 = 0. 6 V   for   all   important   junctions.    (These   equations are given in the previous problems.)
